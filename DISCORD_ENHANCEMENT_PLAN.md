### Voice Channel Best Practices

1. **Naming Convention**
   - Use clear, descriptive names
   - Include capacity limits where relevant
   - Add emoji for visual navigation

2. **Permission Tiers**
   ```
   Public Channels: Everyone can join
   Study Rooms: Push-to-talk enforced
   Tournament Rooms: Verified members only
   Stage Channel: Speaker permissions required
   Private Rooms: Creator has admin rights
   ```

3. **Dynamic Voice Channels**
   - "Create Private Room" spawns temporary channels
   - Auto-delete when empty for 5 minutes
   - Creator gets kick/mute permissions
