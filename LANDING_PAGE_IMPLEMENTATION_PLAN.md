# MTGTools Landing Page Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates all feedback from competitive Magic players and creates a systematic implementation plan for the MTGTools landing page modifications. The core principle guiding all changes is: **"Never put forward features or facts that have not been validated/confirmed."**

### Key Themes Identified:

2. **Add real screenshots/demos** → Visual proof over descriptions
3. **Highlight Videre Project** → Make it the centerpiece
4. **Clarify current status** → Honest timeline and availability
5. **Focus on data, not AI hype** → Real games over simulations

### Success Metrics:
- Grinder trust score: 7/10 → 9/10
- Discord join rate: +50%
- Clear understanding of what MTGTools offers
- Zero misleading claims or unverified features

## Appendix: Key Feedback Quotes to Remember

> "Les grinders veulent voir le produit, pas lire des promesses. Un seul screenshot du tracker en action vaut mieux que 10 paragraphes de marketing."

> "Arrêter de vendre du rêve, montrer du CONCRET"

> "Les grinders veulent des OUTILS, pas un robot qui joue pour eux"

> "Je rejoindrais le Discord maintenant pour suivre, mais j'attendrais de voir une version beta fonctionnelle avant de vraiment m'investir."

These quotes should guide every decision in the implementation process.
