# Agent Organizer Request: Discord Content Seeding Strategy

## Project Context
MTGTools is a community initiative connecting technical talents with competitive Magic: The Gathering players. The Discord server has just been created with 25+ channels but only 2 members. We need to seed the channels with valuable, authentic content to attract developers and competitive players.

## Task Requirements
1. Analyze the Discord channel structure and prioritize content creation
2. Create specific, actionable content for priority channels
3. Develop a 7-day content seeding calendar
4. Design engagement hooks to spark community interaction

## Key Constraints
- Content must be authentic and valuable (no fake engagement)
- Focus on technical discussions that attract developers
- Include competitive Magic insights that appeal to grinders
- Bilingual consideration (French community, English code)
- Each piece of content should invite participation

## Expected Deliverables
1. DISCORD_CONTENT_PRIORITIES.md - Ranked list of channels to populate
2. DISCORD_SEED_CONTENT.md - Actual messages ready to post
3. DISCORD_7DAY_CALENDAR.md - Day-by-day posting schedule
4. DISCORD_ENGAGEMENT_HOOKS.md - Questions and discussion starters

## Technology Stack
- Discord community platform
- Magic: The Gathering (MTGO, Arena, paper)
- C# (MTGOSDK), TypeScript, Python
- Observable for data visualization
- Open source development (GitHub)

## Additional Context
- Videre Project is the flagship with MTGOSDK at its core
- Community formula: "Talents Techniques + Comp√©titeurs = Performance Maximale"
- Focus areas: data-driven tools, metagame analysis, competitive performance
