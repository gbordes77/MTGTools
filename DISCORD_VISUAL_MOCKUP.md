🔵 ContributorSam: Welcome! Check out #faq for getting started
🟢 MagicPro2020: Anyone else seeing weird data for UR Phoenix?

🟢 NewPlayer123: How can I help with classifying decks?
🔵 ContributorSam: Check #archetype-review, we need reviewers!
```

### #archetype-review
```
🤖 ArchetypeBot: New deck needs classification (Confidence: 67%)
   
   DECK PREVIEW:
   4 Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer
   4 Dragon's Rage Channeler
   3 Murktide Regent
   [... more cards ...]
   
   Suggested: UR Tempo
   
   React with:
   ✅ Correct classification
   ❌ Wrong classification
   🤷 Needs subcategory
   
🔵 DataWizard: ❌ This is clearly UR Murktide, not generic tempo
🟢 SpikePlayer: ✅ Agree with DataWizard
🔵 ContributorAlex: ❌ Should be UR Murktide
   
🤖 ArchetypeBot: Consensus reached! Reclassified as "UR Murktide"
   Reviewers earned: +10 accuracy points 🏆
```

   PR: https://github.com/videre-project/Tracker/pull/145
   
🔵 DevContributor: LGTM! Tested on my machine, memory stable now
🟢 NewContributor: Thanks! This was killing my laptop 😅
🟣 Cory[LEAD]: No problem! If anyone wants to tackle #144 next...
