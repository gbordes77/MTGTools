**Mitigation Details**:
- Create Discord server
- Regular blog posts/updates
- Contributor recognition program
- Hackathons and bounties

### R006: Security Vulnerabilities
**Description**: No security scanning or audit processes in place for code handling memory inspection.
**Current Situation**: No automated security checks, manual reviews only.
**Potential Impact**:
- Malicious code injection
- User system compromise
- Legal liability
**Mitigation Details**:
- GitHub security scanning
- Regular penetration testing
- Security-focused code reviews
- Vulnerability disclosure program

### R007: Funding Shortage
**Description**: No current funding model for infrastructure, development, or growth.
**Current Situation**: $0 funding, relying on volunteer work.
**Potential Impact**:
- Cannot scale infrastructure
- Developer burnout
- Project abandonment
**Mitigation Details**:
- GitHub Sponsors setup
- Grant applications (open source funds)
- Premium features model
- Corporate sponsorships

### R008: Scalability Issues
**Description**: Current architecture may not handle growth in users or data volume.
**Current Situation**: No load testing or capacity planning done.
**Potential Impact**:
- Service outages
- Poor user experience
- Infrastructure costs explosion
**Mitigation Details**:
- Load testing implementation
- Caching strategies
- Database optimization
- CDN implementation

### R009: Dependency Vulnerabilities
**Description**: Multiple dependencies across different languages without automated updates.
**Current Situation**: Manual dependency management, no scanning.
**Potential Impact**:
- Security breaches
- Compatibility breaks
- Compliance issues
**Mitigation Details**:
- Dependabot activation
- Weekly vulnerability scans
- Automated update PRs
- Dependency pinning strategy

### R010: Documentation Debt
**Description**: Multiple repositories have no README or documentation.
**Current Situation**: Tracker, mtgo-db, and others lack basic docs.
**Potential Impact**:
- Barrier to adoption
- Contributor confusion
- Increased support burden
**Mitigation Details**:
- Documentation templates
- README requirements
- API documentation generation
- Video tutorials

## Risk Categories

### Technical Risks
**Definition**: Risks related to technology, architecture, and implementation choices.
**Examples in this project**:
- **Platform dependencies (R001)**: MTGO client can change without notice
- **Architecture limitations (R008)**: Current design may not scale
- **Technical debt accumulation**: Code shortcuts that compound over time
**Why it matters**: Technical risks can cause sudden system failures and require significant rework.

### Legal Risks
**Definition**: Risks arising from legal obligations, intellectual property, or regulatory compliance.
**Examples in this project**:
- **Intellectual property concerns (R002)**: Reverse engineering MTGO could trigger legal action
- **Terms of service violations**: Using MTGO in ways not permitted
- **Reverse engineering implications**: DMCA protections may not be sufficient
**Why it matters**: Legal risks can shut down the entire project and create personal liability.

### Operational Risks
**Definition**: Risks in day-to-day operations, processes, and resource management.
**Examples in this project**:
- **Process inefficiencies (R010)**: No documentation standards slow development
- **Communication gaps (R004)**: Broken website link damages credibility
- **Resource constraints (R003)**: Limited contributors with specialized knowledge
**Why it matters**: Operational risks create friction and slow progress.

### Business Risks
**Definition**: Risks affecting market position, user adoption, and financial sustainability.
**Examples in this project**:
- **Market competition**: Other MTGO tools may capture users
- **User adoption challenges (R005)**: Low engagement threatens viability
- **Monetization difficulties (R007)**: No revenue model for sustainability
**Why it matters**: Business risks determine if the project can survive long-term.

### Security Risks
**Definition**: Risks related to data protection, system integrity, and user safety.
**Examples in this project**:
- **Code vulnerabilities (R006)**: Memory inspection code could be exploited
- **Dependency risks (R009)**: Outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities
- **Data breaches**: User data or API keys could be exposed
**Why it matters**: Security breaches destroy user trust and create legal liability.

## Risk Response Strategies

### Accept
**When to use**: Minor impact risks with low probability where cost of mitigation exceeds potential loss.
**Example**: R004 (Website domain) - Low impact, can simply remove reference
**Process**: 
1. Document acceptance decision
2. Monitor for changes
3. Review quarterly

### Mitigate
**When to use**: High probability risks with actionable solutions that reduce likelihood or impact.
**Example**: R001 (MTGO changes) - Implement version detection and abstraction layers
**Process**:
1. Implement specific controls
2. Measure effectiveness
3. Adjust as needed

### Transfer
**When to use**: High-impact risks that can be shifted to third parties through insurance or contracts.
**Example**: R002 (Legal action) - Consider liability insurance or legal entity structure
**Process**:
1. Identify transfer mechanisms
2. Cost-benefit analysis
3. Implement transfer

### Avoid
**When to use**: Critical risks that can be eliminated through design changes or scope adjustment.
**Example**: Avoid storing user credentials by using OAuth instead
**Process**:
1. Identify alternative approaches
2. Redesign to eliminate risk
3. Verify risk elimination

## Review Schedule
