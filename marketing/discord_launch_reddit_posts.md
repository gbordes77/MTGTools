**Title**: [Tool] MTGTools Discord: Data-Driven Competitive Advantage Through Open Source

**Post Content**:

Spikes,

You know that feeling when your tracker is missing crucial data, or when you need specific metagame analysis but can't find it anywhere? We built MTGTools to solve this.

**The Problem**: Most Magic tools are built by developers who don't grind. They don't understand why tracking sideboard patterns matters more than fancy animations.

**Our Solution**: A community where every feature is built BY competitive players, FOR competitive players.

## Current Tools (Live Now):

**Videre MTGO Tracker**:
- Sub-1% CPU usage during matches
- ML-powered archetype detection (95%+ accuracy)
- Real-time win rate tracking
- Sideboard pattern analysis

**MTGTools API**:
- Pull any MTGO data you need
- Custom queries for testing
- Historical matchup data
- Format: `GET /api/v1/metagame/last24h`

## What's Different:

1. **Performance First**: If it doesn't improve winrate, we don't build it
2. **Open Source**: All code public - audit it, improve it, fork it
3. **Grinder-Guided**: Features voted on by verified competitive players
4. **Data Access**: Raw access to millions of games for your own analysis

## Coming Soon:
- Arena integration (Q3 2025)
- Paper tournament tracking
- Custom testing gauntlets
- Team practice tools

**For Developers**: Contribute to tools used in major tournaments  
**For Grinders**: Get the exact features you need to win more

Join the first 100: https://discord.gg/mtgtools

*Where code meets competition. Where data drives decisions.*
