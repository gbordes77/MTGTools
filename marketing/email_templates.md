## 📧 Email 3: Developers & Technical Community

**Subject**: Open source Magic tools need you - Join MTGTools Discord

**Preview**: Where your code directly impacts competitive Magic gameplay

**Body**:
```
Hello {FirstName},

Are you a developer who plays Magic? Or a Magic player who codes?

Either way, MTGTools needs you.

**We're building:**
- Real-time game trackers with <1% CPU usage
- ML models for 95%+ archetype detection
- APIs processing millions of games daily
- Cross-platform tools for MTGO, Arena, and paper

**Our tech stack:**
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Electron
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL  
- ML: TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- Infrastructure: Docker, k8s, GitHub Actions

**What makes us different:**

Your code is used by top competitive players. When you optimize a function, someone's tournament win rate improves. When you fix a bug, a grinder's testing gets better.

This is open source with real impact.

**In the Discord:**
- Code reviews with experienced developers
- Direct feedback from pro players
- Hackathons with real prizes
- Your own project channel when you contribute

**Current opportunities:**
- Postgres migration for scale
- Arena log parsing system
- ML model improvements
- API performance optimization
