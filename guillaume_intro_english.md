# Guillaume Bordes - MTGTools Founder

## My Magic Journey

I've been playing Magic: The Gathering since 1994, starting with Revised Edition. My brother and I discovered the game together, and we've been hooked ever since. While I took a break during the Urza block (those were crazy times!), I came back stronger and have been grinding competitive Magic for years.

## From Player to Builder

My passion for Magic evolved beyond just playing. In 2022, I founded **PERF**, the first French-speaking competitive Magic community. We grew to 150+ members, all focused on improving their game through data and analysis. That experience taught me something crucial: the competitive Magic community needs better tools.

## Why MTGTools?

After years in IT and seeing the fragmentation in Magic tools, I knew we could do better. MTGTools isn't just another project - it's my vision for unifying the competitive ecosystem. By bringing together developers and grinders, we're creating open-source tools that actually make a difference.

## What I Bring

- **30+ years of Magic experience** - I understand what competitive players need
- **IT Professional** - Technical background to bridge dev and player worlds  
- **Community Builder** - Proven track record with PERF
- **Data-Driven Mindset** - Everything we build must improve winrates
- **Open Source Advocate** - Tools should be accessible to everyone

## Let's Build Together

I'm here to forge the future of competitive Magic tools. Whether you're a developer wanting to solve real problems or a grinder looking for better tools, you're in the right place.

The best tools aren't bought. They're forged. Together.
