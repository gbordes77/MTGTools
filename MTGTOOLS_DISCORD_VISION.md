## üåç Internationalization Strategy

### Language Approach
- **Phase 1**: Single bilingual #general-chat (EN/FR welcome)
- **Phase 2**: Add language-specific channels when communities reach critical mass
  - Threshold: ~30 active members speaking the language
  - Examples: #chat-francais, #chat-espa√±ol, #chat-Êó•Êú¨Ë™û
- **Phase 3**: Regional channels for local events/meetups

### Success Examples from Tech Communities
- **Rust Discord**: 15+ language channels, thriving international community
- **Python Discord**: Regional channels that organize local events
- **Vue.js Discord**: Started bilingual, now supports 8 languages

### Benefits of Gradual Approach
- Start inclusive, avoid early fragmentation
- Let demand drive channel creation
- Maintain unified community feel
- Easy to add channels as we grow
