## üí¨ Discord Strategy Discussion

### Current Situation
- We have a team Discord for project management
- Need community engagement (only 24 GitHub stars)

### Recommendation: EXPAND Current Discord

**Why One Discord Instead of Two:**
- Easier management (one moderation team)
- Direct team-community interaction
- Natural contributor pipeline
- Less fragmentation

### Proposed Channel Structure

**üîí Private Team Section**
- #team-general (existing)
- #team-standup (existing)
- #project-management (existing)
- #sensitive-discussions

**üåç NEW Public Community Section**
- #welcome-and-rules
- #announcements 
- #general-chat
- #support-help
- #feature-requests
- #bug-reports

**üõ†Ô∏è Development Channels** (Public but moderated)
- #mtgosdk-dev
- #tracker-dev
- #bot-dev
- #contributing

**üéÆ MTGO Community**
- #mtgo-general
- #deck-tech
- #tournament-discussion

### Role Structure
1. **@Core Team** - Full access
2. **@Contributors** - Dev channels + public
3. **@Community** - Public channels only
4. **@Everyone** - Basic access after verification

### Implementation Steps
1. Create new channel categories
2. Set up roles and permissions
3. Write welcome message and rules
4. Add Discord link to all GitHub repos
5. Announce in existing channels

4. **Security**: Who has permissions to enable GitHub security features?
