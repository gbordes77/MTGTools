# MTGTools Monitoring & Observability Strategy

*Generated: August 5, 2025*  
*DevOps Engineer: Claude Code*  
*For: Guillaume Bordes & MTGTools Operations Team*

## Executive Summary

This strategy establishes comprehensive monitoring and observability for MTGTools, enabling proactive issue detection, performance optimization, and data-driven decisions as we scale from 100 to 10,000+ users.

**Key Principles:**
- **Observability-First**: Instrument everything from day one
- **Proactive Alerting**: Detect issues before users notice
- **Business Metrics**: Connect technical metrics to business outcomes
- **Cost-Conscious**: Efficient monitoring that scales with usage

**Service Instrumentation:**
```typescript
// Example: Node.js API service tracing
import { trace } from '@opentelemetry/api';
import { NodeSDK } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-node';
import { JaegerExporter } from '@opentelemetry/exporter-jaeger';

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  traceExporter: new JaegerExporter({
    endpoint: process.env.JAEGER_ENDPOINT,
  }),
  serviceName: 'api-service',
  serviceVersion: process.env.SERVICE_VERSION,
});

// Trace database operations
const tracer = trace.getTracer('database');

export async function getUserTournaments(userId: string) {
  const span = tracer.startSpan('get_user_tournaments');
  span.setAttributes({
    'user.id': userId,
    'db.operation': 'select',
    'db.table': 'tournaments',
  });
  
  try {
    const tournaments = await db.query(
      'SELECT * FROM tournaments WHERE user_id = $1',
      [userId]
    );
    
    span.setAttributes({
      'db.rows_affected': tournaments.length,
    });
    
    return tournaments;
  } catch (error) {
    span.recordException(error);
    span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR });
    throw error;
  } finally {
    span.end();
  }
}
```

**Trace Context Propagation:**
```yaml
HTTP Headers:
  - traceparent: Version-TraceId-SpanId-Flags
  - tracestate: Vendor-specific trace data

Intra-Service Calls:
  - Propagate context through all async operations
  - Include in database queries
  - Pass to external service calls

Log Correlation:
  - Include trace ID in all log entries
  - Enable trace-to-logs navigation in Grafana
```

### 6.2 Trace Analysis

**Performance Optimization:**
```yaml
Identify Bottlenecks:
  - Find slowest spans in critical paths
  - Analyze database query performance
  - Detect N+1 query problems
  - Optimize external service calls

Error Analysis:
  - Trace error propagation paths
  - Identify root cause of failures
  - Analyze retry behavior
  - Debug intermittent issues
```

## 7. CAPACITY PLANNING

### 7.1 Growth Forecasting

**Metric-Based Forecasting:**
```yaml

  - Exponential growth: Viral adoption scenarios
  - Seasonal patterns: Tournament calendar correlation

Resource Scaling:
  - CPU/Memory per concurrent user
  - Database connections per active user

Capacity Warnings:
  - 70% resource utilization: Plan scaling
  - 85% resource utilization: Execute scaling
  - Storage growth rate > 10GB/day: Review retention
  - Database connection pool > 80%: Scale horizontally
```

### 7.2 Auto-Scaling Configuration

**Kubernetes HPA:**
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2

spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: api-service
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 50
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
  - type: Object
    object:
      metric:
        name: http_requests_per_second
      target:

## 8. COST OPTIMIZATION

### 8.1 Monitoring Cost Analysis

**Cost by Component:**
```yaml

  - Storage: $0.12/GB/month
  - Compute: $100-500/month
  - Index management optimization saves 30%

Jaeger:
  - Storage: $0.08/GB/month (compressed traces)
  - Compute: $30-100/month
  - Sampling reduces costs by 90%

Grafana:
  - Managed service: $50-200/month
  - Self-hosted: $20-50/month compute
```

**Optimization Strategies:**
```yaml
Metrics Optimization:
  - Reduce metric cardinality
  - Implement recording rules
  - Use appropriate retention periods
  - Sample high-frequency metrics

Log Optimization:
  - Structured logging reduces parsing costs
  - Log level filtering in production
  - Compress logs before shipping
  - Use log sampling for high-volume services

Trace Optimization:
  - Head-based sampling (1-10% of traces)

  - Remove noisy, low-value spans
```

### 8.2 ROI Calculation

**Monitoring Investment vs. Downtime Cost:**
```yaml
Monitoring Investment:
  - Setup cost: $5,000 (one-time)
  - Monthly operational cost: $500-2,000
