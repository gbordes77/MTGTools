# MTGTools Language Philosophy

## The Nuanced Approach to Language in Open Source

### Core Principle
**English proficiency ≠ Contribution value**

### The Reality Check

**For Leadership Roles:**
- ✅ English is MANDATORY for project leads
- ✅ International coordination requires English
- ✅ Strategic decisions need clear communication
- ✅ Top competitive players already speak English (GP circuit)

**For Contributors:**
- 🔧 Excellent devs can contribute code without perfect English
- 📊 Data scientists can create algorithms in any language
- 🎨 Designers' mockups are universal
- 🐛 Bug reports can be translated

### Real-World Examples

1. **The French Dev Scenario**
   - Finds critical performance bug
   - Reports in French with code snippets
   - Community translates
   - Bug fixed, everyone benefits

2. **The Data Scientist Case**
   - Creates innovative archetype clustering algorithm
   - Documents in French
   - Code speaks for itself
   - Documentation gets translated
   - Global impact achieved

3. **The Designer Contribution**
   - Proposes new UI for tracker
   - Mockups need no translation
   - Visual improvements benefit all

### Our Approach

**Phase 1: Unified Start**
- Single #general-chat (EN/FR welcome)
- Encourage bilingual exchange
- No artificial barriers

**Phase 2: Organic Growth**
- Add #chat-francais at ~30 active FR members
- Maintain bridges between communities
- Translation volunteers

**Phase 3: Value-First**
- Judge contributions by QUALITY not language
- Provide translation support
- Focus on impact over eloquence

### Key Insight

> "We want to be elitist about QUALITY, not about language."

The best archetype classification algorithm might come from someone who barely speaks English. The most elegant SDK improvement might come from a French developer. We'd be fools to miss out on that talent because of language barriers.

### Bottom Line

- **Leaders** must speak English (international coordination)
- **Contributors** can contribute in any language (code is universal)
- **Value** is measured by impact, not vocabulary

This philosophy ensures we get the best contributions from the global community while maintaining effective leadership and coordination.
